                    <p class="blogIntro">Design has evolved from Graphic Design and branched out to many fields. UX/UI or product design is being used in all companies for creating better experiences. 
                    </p> 
                                           
                    <div class="more">
            
                               
                    <p class="card-text">With invention of touch screen mobile, everyone has access to digital world. Today we have 2d and 3d advancement, audio and video consumption, voice recognition apps and AR/VR advancements, Haptic feedback, sensors which activate based on touch, iris scanner, fingerprint scanner and even blood DNA. AI advancements which can generate images, poems, screen designs, ideas, and much more. In hardware design, people are trying to find out next innovation other than mobile and laptop. </p>
            
                    <h5>Innovation in digital space</h5>
            
                    <p class="card-text">Innovation in digital space is rapid. As described earlier in human psychology the loads in our brain is distributed to Cognition(including memory), visual and motor. When it comes senses, Vision or visual sense triumphs over other senses. Designing for humans should be based on touch and feel. Before touching, the visual perception in our mind should say "yes" so that you can touch the product for interaction. So when you start interacting with a app in mobile you first see the UI with cues and read the text then start interacting using fingers to Tap, swipe, zoom, pinch. This does not take much mental resources than remembering or interacting using voice command for each and every action. Interacting in 3D space with glasses, voice command and auditory feedback, it's like wearing clothes in virtual reality but not wearing clothes in reality. In real world when you wear clothes you feel that we are wearing it. That's touch and feel during interaction with any objects around us. Human knowledge has evolved based on seeing, touch, feel, hearing, smell and taste. We improved our knowledge with trail and error during our interaction and re-learned the experiences. </p>
            
                             
                                
                    <p class="card-text">Gestures in 3D space needs a lot of mental resources. Just imagine you order some 10 different products in 3D AR/VR how many times do you need to wave your hand to move, rotate, zoom. Read the description in AR/VR Lenses(eye will get irritated) with voice feedback or some haptic Feedback. Same, try to order 10 different products using voice commands without using any gestures(Tap, Pinch, Zoom, Swipe) and not seeing a screen in front of you. It gets very complicated. And when your at home your family members interrupt you. You have to remove your AR/VR lenses, connect to headphones and switch on your devices again</p>
            
                    <p class="card-text">Now do the same with mobile, its easy to browse, you can add 10 products and checkout. No waving hands, No Voice Command. No voice feedback. No removing your devices or connecting again. Even when there is distraction, you can return to browsing where you left of with your mobile. Just a button to turn on and off.</p>
            
                               
                    <p class="card-text">Which is easy? One device with just fingers and little mental resources(compared to AR/VR and Voice command) to complete a task or lot of mental resources and many digital devices to do the same task. Moving your finger to create a gesture is better than waving your hands. Isn't it?? and no eye irritation. And cost of manufacturing those AR/VR lenses, the buying cost? How many will afford to buy ?. One Exception is gaming. While Gaming you can use it for long hours. But people get tired while playing for long hours in front of a computer.</p>
            
                    <p class="card-text">Innovating with design should look for simple solutions. Not complicated and not to use too much of mental resources. Do not just try to replace things for sake of it in name of innovation. Remember people will find alternative or consume only when there is a better solution which they use in day-to-day activities.</p>
            
                    <p>Can Artificial Intelligence replace Daydreaming, Mind Wandering, Smell, Taste, Creativity. Can it generate new problems or find new problems based on the data available and generate solutions for it??. We should wait and watch.</p>

                    <h2 class="card-title font-weight500">Interaction Design: Knowledge in the world and head</h2>
            
                    <p class="blogIntro">The <span class="fst-italic">Knowledge in the world</span> is how we perceive and interact with the objects present in the world around us. The picture in the left below shows chair, table, kettle, door handle and water jug / pitcher, which has perceived affordance's(what actions are possible) and signifier's(where the action takes place) to help us interact with the objects. This works at subconscious level which is called Visceral Processing inside our human brain (Human cognition and emotion).
                    </p> 
            
                    <p class="blogIntro"><span class="fst-italic">Knowledge in the head</span> is memory. The skills we learn and practice are stored in our memory. This too works at subconscious level which is called Behavioral level processing. Once we learn and practice for more number of hours it's stored in our memory and we do tasks effortlessly.</p>
            
                    <div class="more">
            
                    <img src="images/blog_knowledge.jpg" class="card-img-top img-fluid mt-2 mb-5" alt="Knowledge in the head and world">
            
                    <p class="card-text">We need both <span class="fst-italic">Knowledge in the world</span> and <span class="fst-italic">Knowledge in the head,  </span> which determines our behavior. When the knowledge is readily available in the word to perform a task, the effort to learn is reduced. Consider a screw, it has projections, you can remove it or replace it effortlessly. The knowledge of removing and replacing is easy because we encounter screws in many of the objects such as chair, shelves, table, drawers and even toys. We know how screw works so the learning is reduced while replacing or removing. Now lets consider playing a musical instrument, the effort put to learn the instrument is high. But once we learn and practice more it stores in our memory and then it becomes easy to play the musical instrument.</p>
            
                    <h5>Applying the above principles to Apps and Web application</h5>
            
                    <p class="card-text">A good design is about discoverability, understanding and having a good conceptual model(something to work). Users spend lot of time with the objects around the world and have a mental model(something will work) in their mind. The expectation the user's have while interacting with a product is based on the knowledge they have. Its important that we design the conceptual model based on this principle.</p>
            
                    <p><img src="images/knowledge_content1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
            
                    <h5>People use a product and expect how it should work.</h5>
            
                    <p class="card-text">Based on past experience and mental model, people while interacting with a product have expectation how something will work.  Discoverability, based on affordances and signifiers like buttons, labels, pictures and links people start interacting using click or swipe gestures to complete the task. Understanding, what does the settings mean?, how to use it?, what each functionalities mean? and how to accomplish the task?</p>
            
                    <p class="card-text">When the expectations do not match users get frustrated and they are unlikely to visit or use the product. Users go elsewhere like other website or apps to get the task completed. User’s who try to use conscious(Reflective Processing) effort to complete a task use lot of mental resources which make them feel uncomfortable in real world by comparing what has happened and with previous experience or reasoning the outcome. Knowledge in the world and head creates a behavior pattern in users. When user confronts a task to be completed, if it is done without much mental effort(subconsciously), the task is easy to accomplish.</p>
            
                    <h5>Knowledge of and Knowledge how</h5>
            
                    <p class="card-text">Knowledge of, is declarative knowledge (rules and facts). Like, ‘Capital city is Delhi’. ‘There are Seven days in a Week’. ‘Earth Revolves around Sun’. ‘We cross the road using Zebra Crossing’. People use this knowledge to understand what is true and what is not true. And rules are not followed everywhere in the world.</p>
            
                    <p class="card-text">Knowledge how, is procedural knowledge. Learning to play a music instrument, catching a ball when it is thrown at you, answering questions when your skills (be it mathematics, science) is tested with much ease. Procedural knowledge is stored at subconscious Level.</p>
            
                    <p>Knowledge in the World, is signifiers, affordances and actions takes that place based on physical constraints. Knowledge in the head, is conceptual model, logical constraints and similarities between what has happened and previous experience. We need both, it’s ineffective when one is left out.</p>

                    <h2 class="card-title font-weight500 ">Design Psychology: Using Psychology while designing UX for your products.</h2>
            
                    <p class="blogIntro">Knowing Psychology about users is time worth spent in designing your User Experience. As the digital world is moving fast at a greater speed, understanding the user’s behavior is more important.
                    </p> 
            
                    <p>As per psychology the human brain consists of more than 80-100 billion neurons, some of them waiting to be wired with new experience that stores as new memory. Every day from the day we are born our brain senses a new smell, sight, touch, sound and taste. Digital world as taken over our lives, we have lot of gadgets around us consuming digital data. So how to design a product with help of psychology that stands out of crowded apps or website. Using Psychology in our User experience design can bridge the gap between your user and product.</p>
            
                    <div class="more">
            
                    <img src="images/design_psych.jpg" class="card-img-top img-fluid mt-2 mb-5" alt="Knowledge in the head and world">
            
                    
                    <h5>Memory – Repetitive action makes memory stick.</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">A lot of mental resources in our brain is processed due to memorizing things. A normal user remembers only four items at a time. Repetitive action makes memory stick. So, placing a home button in the same place in your website/app makes life easier for the user. Even consistent use of phrase of the button makes the user predict the action of the button before he clicks.</p>
                    
            
                    <h5>Thinking – Mental model and Conceptual model</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">When a new product is given to user, based on the mental model the user starts interacting with it. We designers design conceptual model based on assumptions and try to fit the mental model by using task analysis, persona and user journey to validate the mental model while designing the interface. So, understanding the mental and conceptual model makes life easier. Ex: Designing an Online form (conceptual model) with bit-sized chunks and grouping related items like the manual form (mental model) makes life easier for the user.</p>
            
                    <h5>Read – Capital Letters, Small Letters and Length of Text.</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Using capital letters and small letters forms a pattern within the user’s mind. It’s a myth that people can’t read capital letters easily. Both capital and small letters are easy to read by reducing the length of the text between 72 to 100 characters. Aren’t we used to read newspaper? And varying the font size forms a hierarchy for the users.</p>
            
                    <h5>Seeing – Peripheral Vision and Central Vision.</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">We see objects more using Peripheral Vision than using Central Vision. While we walk in traffic, we tend to see the obstacles that come our way by using peripheral vision. So, while browsing a website/app we tend to see more of visual cues using peripheral vision. Visual Cues can be colour, button, links, and images. So, designing visual cues to bring user attention is more important to invite interaction.</p>
            
                    <h5>Attention – Danger, Food, Sex, Movement, Faces and Stories.</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The chemical dopamine in our brain brings attention to danger, food, sex, movement, faces and stories. Using error messages with red colour, images of food, images of celebrity and animation in screen brings more attention to the user. Ex: Notifications popping at your right bottom of your monitor screen (Movement).</p>

                    <p class="blogIntro">As a designer when user interacts with any product we need to understand the actions for the questions from user prespective like, What do I want to accomplish?, What are the alternate action sequences?, What action can i do now?, How do I do it? What happened? What does it mean? and Have I accomplished the goal?. The below design principles when applied answer the user's question while designing a product.</p>

                    <p class="blogIntro">When designers asked about how do you solve the problem while designing user experience. The answer to most of the questions is "It Depends, based on context". As a a designer Understanding Context when creating User Experience design for products is a most essential skill to be learnt. When doing user research, creating IA or creating wireframes context play a important role </p>

                    <h5>Contextual Inquiry in User Research</h5>
            
                    <p class="card-text">Observing user how a task is performed in their natural environment, what behavior patterns do they use to perform a task, do they use any physical items like pencil or paper to take notes, what devices do they use, do they sit or stand, do they sit in a office or daylight or busy environment, do they walk and use mobile or sit before a computer to perform the task. All these observation is part of contextual inquiry. "Designing for context" helps us to create better products.</p>
            
                    
            
                    <h5>Context while creating Information Architecture</h5>
            
                    <p class="card-text">While creating IA, we need to understand how user navigate through a product. IA should help the user to achieve the goal or task while providing correct information at the specific context. Removing, adding content and does the content makes sense for the current context of the task helps user to perform their task with ease. While designing IA we need to understand context from user perspective like, 
                      <ul>
                        <li>Where am I? </li>
                        <li>How did I get here?</li>
                        <li>Where do I go from here? </li>
                        <li>What can I do here?</li>
                      </ul>          
            
                      In IA the term wayfinding and information scent is used frequently. How users find information they want without much effort. How user enters a flow or exits a flow without hassle. Do they find the feature easily they most often use to perform a task. All these can be achieved if we design our IA based on context.
            
                    </p>
            
                    
            
                    <h5>Context while creating UI Design</h5>
            
                    <p class="card-text">While creating UI we need to make sure based on the context of the task we need to place the UI elements in a page. We can disable or enable the UI elements based on context while user is performing the task(Progressive disclosure - show/hide content or UI only for that specific context). When we design for context we can understand which UI elements or UI patterns are needed for the specific page.  </p>
